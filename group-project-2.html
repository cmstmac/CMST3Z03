            <h2>Group Project 2: Tracing Civic Mobility (35% total)</h2>
            <p>Working in pairs (2 people), you will create a GPS drawing by physically moving through space
                to represent "breadcrumbs"—inadvertent traces that migrants and other mobile subjects leave behind.
                Your GPS drawing should connect or respond to topics of weeks 7-10</p>

            <p><strong>What is GPS drawing?</strong> Also known as <i>GPS art</i>, is a method of drawing where an
                artist uses a
                Global Positioning System (GPS) device and follows a pre-planned route to create a large-scale picture
                or pattern. The .GPX data file recorded during the drawing process is then visualised, usually
                overlaying it as a line on a map of the area. Artists usually run or cycle the route—while cars, vans,
                boats and aeroplanes are utilized to create larger pieces. <a

            <h3>Overall Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>By completing this project, students will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create site-specific GPS art:</strong> Develop technical proficiency in route planning, GPS
                    tracking, and spatial mapping to produce original artworks that reveal unexpected patterns and
                    “breadcrumbs” in urban or public spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborate effectively in creative contexts:</strong> Work productively with a partner to
                    combine individual ideas into cohesive GPS drawings, while providing and integrating constructive
                    feedback throughout the creative process.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect artistic practice to theoretical frameworks:</strong> Explore how movement-based art
                    engages with concepts of mobility, migration, and civic engagement, demonstrating understanding of
                    how creative work can illuminate social, spatial, and cultural ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect critically on creative learning:</strong> Articulate and justify creative decisions,
                    evaluate different approaches to GPS drawing, and analyze personal and collaborative growth through
                    both project exhibitions and written reflections.</li>

                    <p><b>By October 27:</b> Post your proposal and provide feedback to your partner and one other
                        student. Early submissions allow you to receive feedback while there are still more peer
                        proposals available.</p>

                    <p><b>October 28 – November 3 (grace period):</b> You can still submit your proposal and provide
                        feedback, but fewer peers may be available for feedback exchange, and no detailed feedback will
                        be provided for late submissions.</p>

                            reflects movement, space, and everyday mobility, with the GPS route as the highlight of your
                            artwork.

                        <p>
                            Each team's GPS drawing composition will be exhibited for the class. Students will explore
                            different drawings in class, view photographic documentation, and interact with the
                            symbolic elements included in the compositions. During the exhibition, you will provide
                            constructive oral feedback to your peers. The full class period is dedicated to this
                            hands-on exhibition experience.

                        <li>Experience and critically engage with peer-created site-specific artworks</li>
                        <li>Develop skills in providing constructive feedback on creative and visual work</li>
                        <li>Practice spatial awareness and observation through the GPS drawing compositions</li>
                        <li>Learn to articulate responses to artistic work in oral discussion</li>

                    <h3>Exhibition Structure</h3>
                    <p>
                        The exhibition will take the form of a <strong>project fair</strong>. Half of the teams will set
                        up at designated booths with their laptops to showcase their GPS drawing compositions and
                        associated materials. During the first hour, the other half of the class will circulate among
                        the booths, explore the projects, and take notes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the first hour, the teams will switch roles: those who were circulating will now take the
                        booths to present their work, while the first group circulates to explore and observe new
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fair will be followed by a brief classroom discussion to share reflections and highlight
                        insights from the exhibition.
                    </p>
