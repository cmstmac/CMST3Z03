In embracing these complexities, the artists crafted a soundwalk that captures both the fragility and vitality of shared acoustic spaces.",

By layering the mundane and the vibrant, Echoes of Contrast invites listeners to notice how routine can blur one‚Äôs sense of time and self, while spontaneous or open spaces restore individuality and connection. Drawing on Cat Hope‚Äôs discussion of locative listening, the work foregrounds sound as a mode of perception that reshapes our relationship to place‚Äîoften more affectively than visual media can.

These sounds reveal the multifaceted ways in which different bodies on campus gain or face limitations in their freedom of movement. A second dimension‚Äîthe roar of engines, screeching brakes, and announcements at the corner bus stop‚Äîlinks campus mobility to the broader urban pulse. These paths remind Sound Walk participants that soundscapes are not only about access rights but also weave into everyday experience.By foregrounding sound as art, the walk also demonstrates how listening practices reveal the dynamic interplay between environment and human mobility. In doing so, it aligns with course discussions about the aesthetic, bodily, and environmental dimensions of movement while grounding them in McMaster‚Äôs lived campus experience.",

Challenges included limited recording times and reduced student activity on weekends, but the use of a wired microphone from the Lyons New Media Centre helped ensure high-quality audio.",
